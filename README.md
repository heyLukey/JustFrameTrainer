# Just Frame Input Trainer
A tool to help build muscle memory for important just frame inputs in Tekken 8 (acid rain, EWGF, etc.).

# To do
- Scale font to screen fit squares in `TargetFrameSequence`.
- Add ability to toggle player side controls.
- Add more input sequences and make them switchable (currently using hardcoded acid rain).
- Add recorded input sequence.
